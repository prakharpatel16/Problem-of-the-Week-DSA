# Week 8 â€“ Problem Set

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 1: Find the Majority Element (MongoDB)
**Question:**  
Given an array of integers, find the majority element (appears more than âŒŠn/2âŒ‹ times). You may assume such an element always exists.  

**Summary:**  
Can be solved using **HashMap frequency counting** or the **Boyerâ€“Moore Majority Vote Algorithm**.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 2: Reverse Words with Delimiters (Facebook)
**Question:**  
Given a string containing words and delimiters, reverse the order of words while keeping delimiters in their original positions.  

**Summary:**  
Approaches include **split + reconstruct**, **two-pointer parsing**, or **stack-based reversal**. Handles multiple delimiters and preserves their relative positions.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem 3: Remove the Maximum Number of Edges (Adobe â€“ Even Tree)
**Question:**  
Given a tree with an even number of nodes, remove the maximum number of edges such that every resulting subtree has an even number of nodes.  

**Summary:**  
Use **DFS to calculate subtree sizes**. If a child subtree has even size, its connecting edge can be removed.

## ðŸ“Š Time & Space Complexity Comparison

| Problem | Best Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Majority Element (MongoDB)** | Boyerâ€“Moore Majority Vote | `O(n)` | `O(1)` |
| **Reverse Words with Delimiters (Facebook)** | Two-Pointer / Stack | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |
| **Remove Maximum Edges (Adobe â€“ Even Tree)** | DFS with Subtree Sizes | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |
