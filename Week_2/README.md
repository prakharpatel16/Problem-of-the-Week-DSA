# ðŸ“š WEEK 2 â€“ DSA Practice Questions

Welcome to **Week 2** of DSA preparation!  
This week's problems are focused on **dynamic programming**, **greedy algorithms**, and **string manipulation** â€” all crucial for cracking interviews and improving problem-solving depth.

## ðŸ”– Questions List:

### âœ… Question 1: Longest Common Subsequence of Three Strings
- **Category:** Dynamic Programming  
- **Difficulty:** Medium  
- **Goal:** Find the length of the longest subsequence common to all three input strings.  
- **Solution File:** `LCS_of_Three_Strings.cpp`  
- **Key Idea:** Use a 3D DP table to track the LCS among prefixes of all three strings.

### âœ… Question 2: Smallest Non-Representable Sum
- **Category:** Greedy Algorithm  
- **Difficulty:** Easy/Medium  
- **Goal:** Given a sorted array of positive integers, find the smallest value that **cannot** be represented as the sum of any subset.  
- **Solution File:** `Smallest_Non_Representable_Sum.cpp`  
- **Key Idea:** Iterate and build the smallest unreachable sum using greedy logic.

### âœ… Question 3: Step Words (Final Pivotal)
- **Category:** HashMap / String Manipulation  
- **Difficulty:** Medium  
- **Goal:** Count how many words in a dictionary can be formed by adding exactly one letter to the base word.  
- **Solution File:** `Step_Words.cpp`  
- **Key Idea:** Use frequency maps or sorted strings to compare base and dictionary words efficiently.
