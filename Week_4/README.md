# üìÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Coding Interview Challenge

Welcome to **Week 4** of the coding interview preparation series.  
This week we cover four fundamental problems that test **graphs, hashing, and string search** ‚Äî common in interviews with companies like **Twitter, Google, and Amazon**.

## üß† Problems Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Count Friend Groups
**Asked By:** Twitter  
**Topic:** Graphs, DFS/BFS, Connected Components  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

We treat the problem as a **graph traversal** task to count connected components.  
For every unvisited student, we start a new DFS/BFS and increment the group count.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ First Recurring Character
**Asked By:** Google  
**Topic:** Hashing, Arrays  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

Find the first element that appears more than once in an array.  
We use a hash set to store visited elements, returning the first duplicate we find.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Search Word in a Grid
**Asked By:** Amazon  
**Topic:** DFS, Backtracking, String Search  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

We search for a word in a 2D grid by moving horizontally or vertically, using DFS with backtracking to avoid revisiting cells.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Practice Problem
**Topic:** Problem-solving  
**Difficulty:** Varies  

Extra problem-solving for reinforcement of Week 4 concepts.
