## 🎮 Problem 1: Misère Nim — Determine if First Player Has a Forced Win

### ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time:** O(1) (for 3 heaps, O(n) in general).  
- **Space:** O(1).  

---

## 🌳 Problem 2: Maximum Path Sum Between Any Two Nodes in a Binary Tree

### ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time:** O(N) (each node visited once).  
- **Space:** O(H) (recursion stack, where H = height of tree).  

---

## 🔢 Problem 3: Minimum Number of Perfect Squares to Sum to N
- Base: `dp[0] = 0`.

### ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time:** O(n * sqrt(n))  
- **Space:** O(n)

## 📦 Summary
| Problem | Concept | Difficulty | Approach |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| 🎮 Misère Nim | Game Theory (XOR, parity) | Medium | Casework + Nim-sum |
| 🌳 Max Path Sum in Tree | DFS, Recursion, DP on Trees | Hard | Post-order traversal |
| 🔢 Min Perfect Squares | DP, Number Theory | Medium | Bottom-up DP |
