# 🎮 Misère Nim — Determine Winner

## 📝 Problem Statement
The game of **Nim (misère version)** is played on heaps of stones:
- ✋ Two players alternate turns.  
- 🪨 On each turn, a player removes **one or more stones from exactly one heap**.  
- 🚫 The player who takes the **last stone loses** (misère condition).  

Given three heap sizes `[a, b, c]`, determine if the **first player** has a forced win assuming both play optimally.

---

## 📥 Input Format
- 📊 An array/list of **three positive integers** `[a, b, c]`.

## 📤 Output Format
- ✅ Return **True** if the first player has a forced win.  
- ❌ Return **False** otherwise.

---

## 🔑 Key Observation (Theory — Misère Nim)

1. 🟦 **If all heaps are of size 1**:  
   - 🎯 First player **wins** iff the number of heaps is **even**.  
   - ❌ If odd, the first player **loses**.  

2. 🟨 **If any heap ≥ 2**:  
   - The game behaves like **normal Nim**.  
   - Compute the **nim-sum** = XOR of all heap sizes.  
   - If `nim-sum != 0` → ✅ First player wins.  
   - Else → ❌ First player loses.

## ⚙️ Algorithm
1. 🔍 Check if all heaps are size `1`.  
   - If yes, return `True` if count is even, else `False`.  
2. 🧮 Otherwise:  
   - Compute XOR of all heap sizes.  
   - If non-zero, return `True`, else `False`.

## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time:** O(1) (since only 3 heaps).  
- **Space:** O(1).
