# ðŸ“˜ Week 5 â€“ Problem Summaries

## 1. Deep Clone a Linked List with Random Pointer (Snapchat)
- **Summary:** Create a deep copy of a linked list where each node has `next` and `random` pointers.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (HashMap) / O(1) (Optimized interleaving approach)  

---

## 2. Flood Fill Algorithm (Facebook)
- **Summary:** Perform a flood fill on a 2D matrix, starting from a given pixel, changing all 4-directionally connected pixels of the same color to a new color.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n Ã— m)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n Ã— m) (BFS queue / DFS recursion stack)

## 3. Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of N Numbers (Amazon)
- **Summary:** Compute the GCD of `n` integers using the Euclidean Algorithm by iteratively applying gcd.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log M), where M is the largest number  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
